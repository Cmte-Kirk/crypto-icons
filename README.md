## Font (CSS)

Download `./css/crypto-icons.css` and font files in `./fonts` directory.

In your HTML use the `<i>` tag with example classes (`crypto-icons` class is required).

	<i class="crypto-icons crypto-icons-bitcoin-double"></i>

Be sure the paths to `../fonts/` are correct wherever you put your css file. Its assumed `./css/` and `./fonts/` are at the same level.

## SVG

See `./svg/` for individual svg icon files.

## Contributing

Easiest thing to do is to send a pull request pointing to an SVG file.

I can add it to the collection and release a new font pack.
